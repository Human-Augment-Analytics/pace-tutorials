## Description

Here, we store our tutorials on using different tools and resources on PACE, before sending them out to be used in PACE's community notes. The [proposed](./proposed/) folder contains all proposed tutorials: those which haven't passed either HAAG's internal quality control or PACE's requirements. The [approved](./approved/) folder contains all apprived tutorials: those which have successfully passed both HAAG's interal quality control and PACE's requirements.
